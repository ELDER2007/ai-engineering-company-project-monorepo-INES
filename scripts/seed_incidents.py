"""Load the historical helpdesk CSV into the incident manager (Phase 3 — seed).

Usage (needs the API's dependencies: pydantic, tinydb ...):
    services/api/.venv/bin/python scripts/seed_incidents.py
    services/api/.venv/bin/python scripts/seed_incidents.py --csv other.csv
    services/api/.venv/bin/python scripts/seed_incidents.py --reset   # wipe the incidents first
    services/api/.venv/bin/python scripts/seed_incidents.py --db /tmp/incidents.json

Reads ``data/raw/incidents-nexova.csv`` by default, validates every row with the
shared ``incidents_analyzer`` rules, transforms it into the incident model
(see ``services/api/incidents/seeding.py`` for the maps) and inserts it with
``origin: "customer"``. Invalid rows are NOT inserted: they are listed here
with their line, id and the rules they break — never the customer's email.
Running it again never duplicates data. At the end it checks that the numbers
``GET /api/incidents/summary`` gives match those expected from the CSV.

Exit codes:
    0   the history is loaded (or was already) and, when the database holds nothing else, it matches the CSV.
        Rows the model rejects are listed but do not make it fail: some rows of the helpdesk export are invalid.
        When the database also holds incidents that are not from the CSV the comparison is skipped, and
        that is a 0 too: the load itself went well.
    1   it failed: file not found or unreadable, not UTF-8 or not CSV, other columns, no data rows, the
        database cannot be opened, nothing was loaded because every row was rejected, or what is in the
        database does not match what the CSV accepts.
